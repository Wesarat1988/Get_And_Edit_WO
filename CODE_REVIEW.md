# Code Review Summary

## Configuration & Secrets
- `MesService.GetMOListAsync` contains hard-coded employee ID, factory information, and a secret key that are compiled into the binary. These should be moved to secure configuration (e.g., `appsettings` + user secrets or Azure Key Vault) with per-environment overrides to avoid leaking sensitive credentials and to support multiple deployments. 【F:BlazorApp5/Services/MesService.cs†L29-L53】
- `ModbusService` also embeds device connection details (IP, port, slave ID, and trigger addresses). Consider binding these settings from configuration so the service can target different lines without code changes. 【F:BlazorApp5/Services/ModbusService.cs†L21-L40】

## External Dependencies
- `BlazorApp5.csproj` references a local `DeltaLibrary 1.dll` via an absolute path into a `Downloads` folder. Builds will fail on any machine that does not have this file in the same location. Check this dependency into source control or distribute it via a NuGet/package feed, and update the project to reference it relative to the repo. 【F:BlazorApp5/BlazorApp5.csproj†L34-L39】
- The project brings in both `NModbus` and `NModbus4.NetCore`. Confirm both packages are required; if only one is used, remove the redundant reference to avoid version conflicts. 【F:BlazorApp5/BlazorApp5.csproj†L27-L31】

## Logging & Observability
- `ModbusService` uses `Console.WriteLine` for diagnostics. Switching to the ASP.NET Core logging abstractions (`ILogger<ModbusService>`) would let you capture structured logs, route them to central sinks, and respect log levels. 【F:BlazorApp5/Services/ModbusService.cs†L178-L205】【F:BlazorApp5/Services/ModbusService.cs†L215-L343】

## Platform Constraints
- `Index.razor` imports Win32 interop and `System.Windows`/`System.Windows.Forms` types. This locks the Blazor Server app to Windows and complicates hosting or automated testing. If desktop automation is required, consider isolating it behind a conditional service or a separate Windows-only process so the server can remain cross-platform. 【F:BlazorApp5/Components/Pages/Index.razor†L12-L137】

## Resilience Enhancements
- Modbus operations currently retry once on transport errors but do not respect cancellation tokens. Surfacing a `CancellationToken` parameter would let the UI cancel long-running polls or stop during shutdown cleanly. 【F:BlazorApp5/Services/ModbusService.cs†L116-L205】
